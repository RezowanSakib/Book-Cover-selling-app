        To show what we mean by declarative code, we want you to imagine the
        following code expressed as an app. What you picture could look like the
        screen below, with a navbar, a header, a filter, and a list. That's
        because each line of code declares what each element of the app is
      </p>
      <h5>How useState Work?</h5>
      <p>
        You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable
        with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and
        another function to update this value
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Ans;
